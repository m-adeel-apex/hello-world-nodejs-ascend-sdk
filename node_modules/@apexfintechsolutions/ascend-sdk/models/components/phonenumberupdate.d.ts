/**
 * An object representing a phone number, suitable as an API wire format.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 *  This representation:
 *
 *  - should not be used for locale-specific formatting of a phone number, such  as "+1 (650) 253-0000 ext. 123"
 *
 *  - is not designed for efficient storage - may not be suitable for dialing - specialized libraries (see references)  should be used to parse the number for that purpose
 *
 *  To do something meaningful with this number, such as format it for various use-cases, convert it to an `i18n.phonenumbers.PhoneNumber` object first.
 *
 *  For instance, in Java this would be:
 *
 *   com.google.type.PhoneNumber wireProto =    com.google.type.PhoneNumber.newBuilder().build();  com.google.i18n.phonenumbers.Phonenumber.PhoneNumber phoneNumber =    PhoneNumberUtil.getInstance().parse(wireProto.getE164Number(), "ZZ");  if (!wireProto.getExtension().isEmpty()) {   phoneNumber.setExtension(wireProto.getExtension());  }
